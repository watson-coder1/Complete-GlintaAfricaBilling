# Commands to find your bypassed phone on MikroTik

# 1. First, let's see ALL devices currently connected (active and inactive)
/ip dhcp-server lease print

# 2. Check active hotspot sessions
/ip hotspot active print

# 3. Check ALL hotspot hosts (this shows all devices that have connected)
/ip hotspot host print

# 4. Check ARP table for all devices
/ip arp print

# 5. Check if there are any firewall rules allowing specific IPs
/ip firewall filter print where action=accept and src-address~"192.168"
/ip firewall nat print where action=accept

# 6. Check address lists for any bypass entries
/ip firewall address-list print

# 7. Check for any static DHCP entries that might bypass
/ip dhcp-server lease print where dynamic=no

# 8. Check hotspot user profiles for unlimited access
/ip hotspot user print
/ip hotspot user profile print

# 9. Check if any devices are bypassed through MAC authentication
/ip hotspot host print where bypassed=yes

# 10. To find your phone specifically, look for these patterns:
# For iPhone:
/ip dhcp-server lease print where host-name~"iPhone"
/ip dhcp-server lease print where comment~"phone"

# For Android:
/ip dhcp-server lease print where host-name~"android"
/ip dhcp-server lease print where host-name~"Samsung"
/ip dhcp-server lease print where host-name~"Xiaomi"
/ip dhcp-server lease print where host-name~"OPPO"

# 11. Check WiFi connections
/interface wireless registration-table print

# 12. See all connections in last 24 hours
/ip hotspot host print where uptime<24:00:00

# IMPORTANT: Your phone might be bypassed through:
# 1. Not appearing in hotspot at all (firewall rule bypass)
# 2. Static DHCP lease with special treatment
# 3. Address list bypass
# 4. Direct NAT rule
# 5. Bridge/interface bypass

# To see EVERYTHING at once:
/ip firewall address-list print
/ip firewall filter print where action=accept
/ip firewall nat print where action=masquerade or action=accept
/ip hotspot walled-garden print
/ip hotspot walled-garden ip print
